----------------------
 Manuel Bachmann <manuel.bachmann@iot.bzh>

 Description :
 ***********
  A QML plugin able to detect and use radio hardware, most notably RTL2832U
chipsets (although it can easily be extended).
  It also provides :
- multiple radio hardware discovery ;
- general status summary ;
- AM/FM mode switching ;
- frequency switching ;
- mute on/off switching ;
- ...

 Installation :
 ************
$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

 Testing :
 *******
$ qmlscene radio.qml

 (if the plugin has been installed to a non-standard location, you will need to
  specify its "qml" directory manually, by doing e.g. :
$ qmlscene -I /opt/lib/qt5/qml radio.qml )

 License :
 *******
Being massively based on the "rtl-sdr" library, it logically inherits its GPLv2
license.

 Requirements :
 ************
g++ (4.7 minimum for C++11 support), Qt >= 5.0, rtl-sdr >= 0.5.0, libusb-1.0,
alsa.
("rtl-sdr" can be fetched with "$ git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr")
